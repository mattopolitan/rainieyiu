## What You Should Know About Our WhatsApp features?What You Should Know About Our WhatsApp features?

### üì±Customer support using WhatsApp
There is a huge advantage in providing customer support via whatsap compared to regular chat. While in Chat the customer might leave the website before you replied, with WhatsApp you can be sure that the customer will always get your messages directly to his WhatsApp on mobile device or computer.

Sometimes you might need several hours to get to customers, with a regular chat plugin you will end up sending the customer an email which is a completely different communication. Using WhatsApp is simply the most efficient way to increase your chance to convert users to paid customers.

Small TIP from us: While chatting with customers on Facebook Messanger, use icons and gifs. It makes your customers like you more üôÇ


## Why you should not use Instant messaging over Chat on your website
- Always available - When customers contact you via instant messaging chat you can always get back to them and be sure that they will get your reply. This is not the case with regular chat plugins because if you didn't answer a customer almost right away - you lost a customer.
- Better personalization - For using instant messaging chats, your customers must have an online profile which can already tell you their name, it‚Äôs a nice advantage over a chat because you can approach them personally. If you provide services to countries around the world, you can already know the customers‚Äô country when they contact you via Whatsapp chat, Viber, Facebook Mesenger, Telegra, Line, Skype and more.
- No signup, No blockers - Chatt plugins ask your customer for their email and name because they know that you‚Äôre not always available so the cha apps wants to allow you to get back to your customers. But very often the customers don‚Äôt want to leave their email address and name, they just want to chat with you and ask their questions. The outcome of it is that they don‚Äôt leave their email and leave your website. With instant messaging they don‚Äôt need to leave any information, they simply click on the relevant instant messaging platform they prefer and start chatting with you. That simple!!


## Design your chat button to fit your website style

Smartarget offers different types of chat buttons: Whatsapp chat button, WeChat button, telegam button, click to call button, Facebook Messenger button, Viber chat button and many more.

All our buttons are fully customized so you can fit the button color and style to your website branding. The button can be located in different positions on your website, for example you can locate it on computer screens in one position and the button on mobile would be located in another position. It‚Äôs clear that computer and mobile screens are not the same, that‚Äôs why we allow you to have different chat botton position on different platforms.

In addition to choosing the buttom position, you can also choose the shape. Our chat plugin allows you to have a rounded circle chat button or rectangle button with rounded corner. You can also choose if your chet button will include call to action text or not.


## üë®‚Äçüíª Smartarget offers 3 Types of Popup apps

Smartarget offers different types of Popups, they‚Äôre super simple to configure an you don‚Äôt need any technical knowledge for it.

### Popup - Keep It Simple Stupid

### Exit Popup - Reduce Customers Churn

You spend a lot of time and money to bring customers to your website, with Exit Popup you can keep users on the website for longer and increase the chance that they will become a paid customer.
